I am currently a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) student in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence (MLMI) Program](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/), at [the University of Cambridge, Deparment of Engineering](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/). 

I received a Bachelor's of Science (BSc) degree in Computer Science Combined Mathematics at [the University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver, BC, Canada. During my undergrad, I explored a wide range of academic interests, and had pleasures of working with exceptional professors, including [Prof. Rachel Pottinger](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/rachel-pottinger) (databases), [Prof. Chen Greif](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/chen-greif) (numerical analysis), [Prof. Anotida Madzvamuse](https://www.math.ubc.ca/user/3665) (mathematical biology), etc. During my undergrad, I have also finished 4-term [Co-op (Co-operative Education)](https://sciencecoop.ubc.ca/prospective/apply/cs) - 2 term in [Simba](https://insightsoftware.com/simba/), and 2 term in [BC Cancer Research Center (BCCRC)](https://www.bccrc.ca/).

My current research interests span AI/ML topics, including natural language processing, computer vision/graphics, human-computer interaction, etc.
